# Sprint 3 Journal
Note: Our requirements document did not change this sprint.

## Testing
The login functionality of our project uses both automated and manual testing. The automated tests handle backend cases,
such as testing whether two users can be created with the same username/email, testing whether an inactive account can login
to the website, etc. Since our app sends verification emails to Grinnell email accounts, it is necessary to test other
functionality manually. For example, testing what happens when users go to their email and click the verification link,
and testing an end-to-end registration process where users create an account, activate it, sign in, and sign out 
(via the sign-out link on the page or by closing their browser window).
