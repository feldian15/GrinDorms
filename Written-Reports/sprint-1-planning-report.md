# Capacity:
How much work can your team do this sprint? (More, less, or the same as last sprint.) Consider each team member's availability and how accurate your time estimates were for last week's tasks.
Write the estimates using some unit of time or effort (e.g. hours or beans). If the unit is not a common measure of time, include a description of what the unit means.  

# Goals: 
Name the outcomes you plan to complete this sprint. Consider your backlog and the parameters of this week's milestone.
Task breakdown: For the work you plan to do this sprint, summarize the component parts. (Ok to just refer to your issue tracker.)  
 
# Assignment: 
What will each team member do this sprint?  

# Issue Tracker:   
How can your instructor view the results of your sprint planning using your issue tracker?  
Make sure that issues within your issue tracker are well formed. A well formed issue is:
Well defined: includes a meaningful title and a description outlining the details of the issue
Scoped: has an estimate of the time or effort needed to complete
Verifiable: has a clear, unambiguous description of how to know when it is done
Indecomposable: can't be broken down into smaller parts that could stand on their own
Make sure that issues for this sprint can easily be seen in your issue tracker even after the end of the sprint.
