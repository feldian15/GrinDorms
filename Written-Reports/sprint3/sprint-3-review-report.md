# Sprint 3 Review Report

## Work Completed
### How has your product improved or progressed from a customer perspective?
- We have taken our demo/practice code and adapted it to create a better functioning demo. The user interface has been styled in most places and is easier to navigate. Additionally, we have made progress on the login page to make the process more streamlined, and actions on the site are easier to understand.

### What progress have you made that is not visible to a common user?
- Our code is much more readable and efficient, and we have begun staging all room and building information on campus. We have also started work on expansive UI testing to ensure our product functions the correct way in all use cases.

#### For each user-facing feature that is operational, describe steps to activate that feature in the user interface.
- To browse available rooms on campus, navigate to the home page and click the link to browse. Once on the browse page, use the available filters at the top to find rooms matching a certain criteria. To submit filters, use the apply button at the bottom of the filter panel. This will reload the page and the available rooms. To clear all filters, hit the clear button.
- To find information on a specific room, click on a room from the browse page. Once the details page has loaded you can view any information about the room on the page.
- To review a room, navigate from the homepage to the review link. Once on the review page, progress through the drop down menus until you have landed on the room you want to review. Here you can submit a rating, a comment, and any pictures. You can submit multiple pictures by uploading multiple at a time. To submit the review, click the submit button. If your information is correct, you will be navigated to a success page, where links back to the homepage or to your existing reviews can be found
- To view your existing reviews, navigate home and click the view my reviews link. From here you will find a page with all of your reviews. You can choose to remove any of these reviews by selecting the delete button. This will bring you to a page that displays another success message.
