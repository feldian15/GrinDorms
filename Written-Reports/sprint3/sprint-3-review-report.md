# Sprint 3 Review Report

Describe what you completed this sprint.
How has your product improved or progressed from a customer perspective? Describe in terms of high level 
features that a non-technical user could recognize and appreciate.
What progress have you made that is not visible to a common user?

For each user-facing feature that is operational, describe steps to activate that feature in the user interface. The steps should be clear enough that your instructor can follow them while grading your work, without help from your team.
