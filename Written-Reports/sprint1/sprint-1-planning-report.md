# Capacity:
Each person will put in maximum up to 10 hours of work over the next two weeks (around one hour a day).

# Goals: 
By the end of this sprint, we will have a paper prototype and will have tested it with three people not in the class. We will have completed 6 use cases. We will begin to plan the database schema for our website. We will also plan the website's UI.

# Assignment: 
Everyone will help make the paper prototype. When testing with users, Ella and Nitin will take turns being facilitators, Ian and Mac will take turns recording, and Tim and Rene will take turns being the computer. We will all work together in planning the database. Ian will add issues to the Trello. 

# Issue Tracker:   
All of the issues are added to our Trello (link in repo README) and are labeled with the green Sprint 1 label.
