# Capacity: How much work can your team do this sprint? (More, less, or the same as last sprint.) Consider each team member's availability and how accurate your time estimates were for last week's tasks.
- We collectively agree that we can accomplish more in this sprint.

# Write the estimates using some unit of time or effort (e.g. hours or beans). If the unit is not a common measure of time, include a description of what the unit means.
- Each person will put in a maximum of 12 hours of work over the next two weeks, plus potentially some additional time during spring break.

# Goals: Name the outcomes you plan to complete this sprint. Consider your backlog and the parameters of this week's milestone.
- System architecture and design, database architecture, process description, continuous integration plan, test automation and CI setup.

# Task breakdown: For the work you plan to do this sprint, summarize the component parts. (Ok to just refer to your issue tracker.)
- System architecture: Layer diagram
- System design: we will map out the components of the source code interact with each other
- database architecture: we will give a draft of our database schema
- process description: complete a risk assessment, develop epics, create a timeline, and make a documentation plan
- Continuous integration plan: We will add a developer guidelines page detailing our testing library and how to contribute to the source code
- test automation and CI setup: We will setup the test suite
- Additional work for this sprint: **Link Django to Postgres database and get our project incorporated on reclaim cloud**
