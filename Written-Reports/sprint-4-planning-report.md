# Sprint 4 Planning Report

Capacity: How much work can your team do this sprint? (More, less, or the same as last sprint.) Consider each team member's availability and how accurate your time estimates were for last week's tasks.
Write the estimates using some unit of time or effort (e.g. hours or beans). If the unit is not a common measure of time, include a description of what the unit means.

- We are able to do the same amount of work as last sprint on average. Since our basic product is working, there is less to do and more time. We still anticipate everyone contributing around 12 hours of work each over the next two weeks.

Goals: Name the outcomes you plan to complete this sprint. Consider your backlog and the parameters of this week's milestone.

- update the product with all of the changes we identified in our issue log
- (Hopefully) host the website
- (hopefully) integrate the database
- Finish user documentation and finish stakeholder meetings
- Finish automated testing

Task breakdown: For the work you plan to do this sprint, summarize the component parts. (Ok to just refer to your issue tracker.)

- Refer to issue tracker

Assignment: What will each team member do this sprint?

- Same basic assignments as last week. Rene and Mac are on styling, Nitin is on web hosting, ella and tim are working on login functionality, Ian is cleaning up review and browse functionality, and Ian, Tim and Ella are writing selenium tests.

Issue Tracker: How can your instructor view the results of your sprint planning using your issue tracker?
Make sure that issues within your issue tracker are well formed. A well formed issue is:
Well defined: includes a meaningful title and a description outlining the details of the issue
Scoped: has an estimate of the time or effort needed to complete
Verifiable: has a clear, unambiguous description of how to know when it is done
Indecomposable: can't be broken down into smaller parts that could stand on their own
Make sure that issues for this sprint can easily be seen in your issue tracker even after the end of the sprint.
