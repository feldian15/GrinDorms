# Sprint 2 Review Report

In addition to the assigned sprint tasks, we have made progress in work that we have chosen to do, outside of the required work. 
We had three main tasks that we completed outside of the required work:
1. Create a user authentication sub-app that can handle user creation, ensure that users can only sign up with a Grinnell email,
   verify their email, reset their password, and make sure that users can only access certain web pages if they sign in with a verified,
   active account. 
2. We began development on the browsing and reviewing portions of the site. Basic filtering functionality was implemented with basic review posting
   and deletion. We added templates and views for browsing, reviewing, and editing reviews. We also added support for image posting and
   constructed a test database for Rooms, Buildings, Reviews, and Images.
3. We have done work in the Reclaim Cloud environment in order to prepare for the public deployment of our website. We understood how to
   deploy to web, and further understood how our environment is structured. We created a script for one click deployment, then
   added error checking to the one click deployment and integrated it with our Github.

Parts 1 and 2 can be found in our GitHub repo in the Demos folder. We have not come up with tests for all of the code we created, but we 
have a plan on what tests we need to implement before the end of the next sprint. 

In this sprint, our product has progressed as we implemented core functionality to meet a variety of use cases like signing in, 
browsing rooms, and posting a review.
