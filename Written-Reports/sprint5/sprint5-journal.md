# Sprint 5 Journal
## Adoption Plan (Wednesday, April 30)
### Current State
- At the time of writing, our product is almost ready for adoption. The internal functionality of the site is complete and usable. The only missing piece currently is our email verification functionality. 

### Risk Analysis
- User verification doesn't work, and people can use the site without being a Grinnell Student
- The lack of protection for email verification dissuades people from using the site, limiting the amount of crowdsourced data.
- Because of the time specific nature of the project, users forget that the resource exists and no one contributes or uses the site.
- Users post fraudulent reviews of rooms they have not lived in
- Users post harmful or sensitive information on the site.
 
### Benefit Analysis
- Users can access room specific information more easily than the current process and view actual opinions of the rooms

### Viable Product
- We feel confident that our verification process will be finished before the end of the semester. However, we are not ready at this time to encourage people to adopt the product.

### Continued Development
- Our product will be ready after we get the user verification functionality and web hosting figured out. Currently, we cannot verify that users are grinnell students, and our web hosting platform is throwing some internal errors with our database. We believe we can fix these issues by the end of the semester, but they are integral to our product, so we cannot proceed to adoption without these pieces.
- Additionally, we are currently missing test code for some of our code. We still need to write integration tests for our full site.
