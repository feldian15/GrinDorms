## Overview:
GrinDorms is a web hosted platform designed to aid students in making informed decisions for the room selection process at Grinnell College.
It provides photos, ratings, and personal reviews of rooms, submitted by student residents.
The mission of GrinDorms is to make information about dorm rooms publicly available to Grinnell College students 
so they can make informed decisions during room selection. This website enables students to create a verified account, post anonymous room reviews, and browse reviews from other students. Through our website, students can gain valuable information about rooms as well as view images of rooms, something that is not currently an option for Grinnell students. 

## Motivation:
GrinDorms solves a common complaint among Grinnell College students: Room Draw. Traditionally, there are only floor plans available for 
students to view rooms, which are confusing to navigate, outdated, and lacking in information that students are interested in. 
To see how rooms actually look, students need to make arrangements with current residents.
GrinDorms solves this issue by providing a crowdsourcing platform for information about Grinnell dorm rooms. The target users are Grinnell
College students wanting to search information about on-campus housing options and specific rooms, or anonymously 
post reviews for rooms they have lived in to help other students find a room that meets their needs.

## Product:
Users are able to access this product via a public URL. Users must register an account using a Grinnell email address, and verify the account via a link sent to that email. Once the account creation process is complete, users are able to sign in with their username and password to access webpages to browse room reviews, post their own room review, and view/delete any reviews they created in the past. If a user forgets their username or password, they are able to reset the password via a link sent to their Grinnell email. The browse page of the website allows users to filter rooms based on specifications like star rating, location on campus, number of people per room, etc. The rooms that meet their specifications are listed on the page, and users can click on individual room listings to view the ratings a pictures for that room. The review page allows users to submit a room review by writing a comment, rating the room on a five-star scale, and optionally providing images of the room. Room reviews are anonymous, but users are able to see a list of the reviews they have posted in the past and delete them at any time.  

## Process:
As advised by our professor, our team utilized an agile development methodology, which involved breaking down the project into manageable sprints, creating epics spanning multiple sprints, keeping track of our issues in a Trello board, and holding weekly meetings outside of class time to share our progress and assist each other.

One challenge we faced was changing our paper prototype based on user feedback. Our testers gave us feedback on improving the process to browse rooms on campus. Initially, our paper prototype only allowed for users to compare rooms located in the same dorm buildings. Test users requested functionality to compare rooms across all dorm buildings. In the images below, the left depicts our original prototype flow, and the right is a sketch of ideas for the improved browse page. The final image in this section depicts our first user test, with a classmate. It took effort to agree on the best solution for users to browse rooms, requiring open and honest communication between team members and stakeholders.

Our group learned to be patient throughout the planning and development process, and remain open to feedback from our professor, classmates, test users, and each other. It is important to incorporate feedback throughout the development process and ask many people for feedback as possible in order to create the best version of your product.

## Advice:
Our advice for other students is to have a positive attidude and good sense of humor when working on a project like this. Groupwork is more fun when teammates have built trust with one another and are able to have fun while working together.
