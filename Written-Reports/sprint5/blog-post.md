## **TODO: Overview:**
A few sentences briefly summarizing your whole post

## **Motivation:**
GrinDorms solves a common complaint among Grinnell College students: Room Draw. Traditionally, there are only floor plans available for 
students to view rooms, which are confusing to navigate, outdated, and lacking in information that students are interested in. 
To see how rooms actually look, students need to make arrangements with current residents.
GrinDorms solves this issue by providing a crowdsourcing platform for information about Grinnell dorm rooms. The target users are Grinnell
College students wanting to search information about on-campus housing options and specific rooms, or anonymously 
post reviews for rooms they have lived in to help other students decide where they would like to live.
