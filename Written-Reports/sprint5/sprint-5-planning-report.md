# Sprint 5 Planning Report

## Capacity:
Our team members will not be able to put in a lot of work during the first week of the sprint due to prior commitments 
and work/exams for other classes. We are able to do a little less work than last sprint due to this.  However, the team will dedicate significant time and effort during the second half of the 
sprint to complete all deliverables and get our product up and running. We will be able to dedicate 5-6 hours each on this sprint. 

## Goals:
Our goals for this sprint are to complete all sprint deliverables including the adoption plan, bug logging, license, final presentation, 
and blog post. For our self-selected work, we will work together to populate our database with basic information for each room and we will 
clean up our existing code. We will also finalize the final deployment of our website so that people can start using it. 
The goals for this sprint can be found in our issue tracker (https://trello.com/b/fiZwfAwq/grindorms) under the Sprint 5 label.

## Assignment:
Everyone will do work to make our repository presentable to future audiences by doing code cleanup and creating final documentation.
