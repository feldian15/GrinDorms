# Sprint 5 Review Report

This sprint, our team added important features to wrap up our project. We enabled our website to have a public URL, allowing users outside of our team to access the website, create an account, and post/browse room reviews. By hosting our website through Reclaim Cloud, we were
able to resolve the email problems we encountered through local hosting, and our website is now able to send emails over
the school wifi on any computer. Now, users can properly verify their account and reset their account password via links sent by our website to their Grinnell email address. We also improved our filtering panel on the room broswing page, automatically refreshing the room list based on user selections instead of users having to click a button to refresh the room list. Also, we have finished uploading all basic room data to our database, allowing users to access information about all rooms on campus, including Renfrow (but excluding Loose, which is still under construction). One bug we addressed this sprint was a small issue with image posting. To resolve the issue, we restricted users to only upload image files with jpeg or png extensions.
