# Sprint 4 Journal

## Internal Documentation Lab

For each subgroup:
- Name the members of that subgroup
- Identify the code that you worked with in the lab (e.g. calico.java, lines 1-437)
- Write a paragraph to describe the changes that you made to the code and the documentation
- Identify existing documentation that was helpful
- Identify the commit hash of the commit in which you wrote your new documentation. Provide a Github link where your instructor can view the diff of that commit.
- If you created or updated any issues in your issue tracker, show a "before" and "after" snapshot of the detailed view of each issue so that the difference can clearly be seen
