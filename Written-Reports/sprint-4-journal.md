# Sprint 4 Journal

## Internal Documentation Lab

For each subgroup:
- Name the members of that subgroup
- Identify the code that you worked with in the lab (e.g. calico.java, lines 1-437)
- Write a paragraph to describe the changes that you made to the code and the documentation
- Identify existing documentation that was helpful
- Identify the commit hash of the commit in which you wrote your new documentation. Provide a Github link where your instructor can view the diff of that commit.
- If you created or updated any issues in your issue tracker, show a "before" and "after" snapshot of the detailed view of each issue so that the difference can clearly be seen

### Rene & Tim
#### Code
- 'rooms_details.css', 'rooms_home.css', 'my_reviews.css'
- To improve the readability and maintainability of the CSS code, I added a comment before every @media rule across all .css files. The comment explains that the media queries apply specific styling changes when the browser window is resized to a lower resolution, based on the pixel value defined in the media parameter. This documentation helps clarify the purpose of the media query for future developers or team members, indicating that the specified elements (such as headings, fieldsets, and images) will adapt their layout and styling dynamically for smaller screen sizes.
