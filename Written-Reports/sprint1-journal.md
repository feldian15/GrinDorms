# Sprint 1 Journal
## Part 1: Revise requirements based on proposal review feedback
- We utilized the review feedback as we were creating the requirements document, so we did not make any later changes based on the feedback.
- Based on the feedback, we thought it was important to provide an option for users to edit/remove their posts due to privacy concerns in order to make our product more ethical. This fits into the Room Poster user story and the features users might want. 

## Part 3: Paper Prototype (TODO)
- Three use cases for our prototype are:
1. Finding information about a specific dorm room on campus. (Alternative flow: room has not yet been reviewed)
3. Finding information about a specific dorm building on campus
4. Posting a new room review / editing/removing past reviews. (Alternative flow: missing response fields)

### One or more photos of your prototype

### Photos of your team working on the prototype


### Review questions: (Ask these to stakeholders)
- What aspects of the interface were intuitive to use? What aspects were not? Why? What would make them easier to use?
- How likely are you/would you have been to use this product for room draw? What is the primary purpose you would use it for?
- How likely is it that you would post a review? How likely would you be to browse the rooms?
- What type of information would you like to see about the dorms? The floors? And the rooms?
 - number of bathrooms, kitchen size/pictures, information about surrounding roooms
- Which elements of the interface, if any, were distracting or confusing? Why or why not?
- How comfortable would you feel posting pictures of your furnished room?

## Test 1 (Classmate)
### Who you tested it with.
- Budhil
### A narrative describing the test.
 - Budhil is a student who is browsing to find details on Gates 8100, a room he would like to live in next year. He is planning to live with one roommate and wants to find a double room.
### What roles did each team member play during the test?
- Ella: Facilitator
- Nitin: Computer
- Ian: Note taker
### Which user stories were activated?
- "As a group dorm seeker, I need to be able to find rooms that are designed exactly for the size of my roommate group."
### Additional notes describing the session, e.g. observations of the test user's behavior.
- The user did not have any issue navigating the interface. He interacted with our application in roughly the way we would expect.
### The feedback you got from the tester
- Budhil requested navigation buttons between webpages to make going back easier. He also inquired about adding upvotes and downvotes to the comments or a flag option.
### Notes on how to revise your testing procedure for the next user
- We should slow down some and give a better description of the use case we are testing. Budhil was prone to go outside the use case because we had not made his goal clear.
### Describe changes to your prototype
- We will add a flag option on the user reviews to allow users to flag any content they feel should be reviewed by admin.
### other changes your team decided to make from your own thoughts and ideas from the testing session
- When linking an unreviewed room to a review page, we will ideally have the dorm room information propogated already.
### other things you added to your prototype, not necessarily based on the testing session
- We will add an option for users to see all of their reviews and delete any they may have made a mistake on or do not wish to share anymore. We also will add a dorm and floor information panel on each respective screen to better highlight details of each.
### Include one or more photos of your revised prototype where the difference between the original and revised version can be plainly seen

-  Leah enagaged with the prototype as we expected.
### The feedback you got from the tester
- adding a box that let the user confirm after they press the delete button for their reviews
### Notes on how to revise your testing procedure for the next user
- we have created standardized review questions to ask users after each test.
### Describe changes to your prototype
- there will be a page that allow the user to confirm after they click the delete button.
### other changes your team decided to make from your own thoughts and ideas from the testing session
- Add a save button when editing past reviews, add a popup that says "are you sure" after clicking delete on a past review.
- Add a popup to allows users to explain why they have flagged/reported a review. 
### other things you added to your prototype, not necessarily based on the testing session
- We added a page to look at all past reviews, that the user gets naviagated to once they post a new review. 
### Include one or more photos of your revised prototype where the difference between the original and revised version can be plainly seen

## Test 3 (Kailee)
- We tested this with Kailee, a fourth-year Grinnell College student who is a real stakeholder in our website. She is a naive user, as she did not know about our project before our test with her. 
- We tested with Kailee because we were interested in exploring the use case for room poster, and were interested in learning about whether fourth-year students would be interested in reviewing rooms on our website even if they are graduating and will not use the website to browse room reviews.
### Date and time of the test session**
- Tuesday February 25 at 5:01
### A narrative describing the test.
- Kailee was instructed first to act like a student who was exploring the website for the first time. She began by browsing rooms and then posted a review of her current room.
### What roles did each team member play during the test?
- : Facilitator: Ella
- : Computer: Tim
- : Note taker: Ian
### Which user stories were activated?
- Room Poster
- Room reviewer
### Additional notes describing the session, e.g. observations of the test user's behavior.
- The session went pretty smooth, but she bypassed a lot of the preliminary information about the buildings and floors and just wanted to get to the room information.
### The feedback you got from the tester
- She questioned whether the pictures should be related to the reviews they came with or whether they should be in separate panes. She also inquired about filtering rooms and sorting based on highest rating. She also noted the shifting placement of the home button and its small size relative to the information on the page.
### Notes on how to revise your testing procedure for the next user
- We will ask the next user how they feel about the setup of the room details page and whether they like the setup of the panes.
### Describe changes to your prototype
- Made a larger home button, potentially will try grouping the reviews with their related pictures after the following review
### other changes your team decided to make from your own thoughts and ideas from the testing session
- We mi
### other things you added to your prototype, not necessarily based on the testing session

### 3 major questions that you asked the test user for feedback on, and the test user's responses.

### Spontaneous feedback from the test user, and questions you came up with on the spot
