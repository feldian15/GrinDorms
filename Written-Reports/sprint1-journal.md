# Sprint 1 Journal
### Review questions: (Ask these to stakeholders)
- What aspects of the interface were intuitive to use? What aspects were not? Why? What would make them easier to use?
- How likely are you/would you have been to use this product for room draw? What is the primary purpose you would use it for?
- How likely is it that you would post a review? How likely would you be to browse the rooms?
- What type of information would you like to see about the dorms? The floors? And the rooms?
- Were any elements of the interface distracting or confusing? Why or why not?
- Would you feel comfortable posting pictures of your furnished room?

## Test 1 (Classmate)
### Who you tested it with.
- Budhil
### A narrative describing the test.
 - Budhil is a student who is browsing to find details on Gates 8100, a room he would like to live in next year. He is planning to live with one roommate and wants to find a double room.
### What roles did each team member play during the test?
- Ella: Facilitator
- Nitin: Computer
- Ian: Note taker
### Which user stories were activated?
- "As a group dorm seeker, I need to be able to find rooms that are designed exactly for the size of my roommate group."
### Additional notes describing the session, e.g. observations of the test user's behavior.
- The user did not have any issue navigating the interface. He interacted with our application in roughly the way we would expect.
### The feedback you got from the tester
- Budhil requested navigation buttons between webpages to make going back easier. He also inquired about adding upvotes and downvotes to the comments or a flag option.
### Notes on how to revise your testing procedure for the next user
- We should slow down some and give a better description of the use case we are testing. Budhil was prone to go outside the use case because we had not made his goal clear.
### Describe changes to your prototype
- We will add a flag option on the user reviews to allow users to flag any content they feel should be reviewed by admin.
### other changes your team decided to make from your own thoughts and ideas from the testing session
- When linking an unreviewed room to a review page, we will ideally have the dorm room information propogated already.
### other things you added to your prototype, not necessarily based on the testing session
- We will add an option for users to see all of their reviews and delete any they may have made a mistake on or do not wish to share anymore. We also will add a dorm and floor information panel on each respective screen to better highlight details of each.
### Include one or more photos of your revised prototype where the difference between the original and revised version can be plainly seen
