# Sprint 1 Journal
## Part 1: Revise requirements based on proposal review feedback
- We utilized the review feedback as we were creating the requirements document, so we did not make any later changes based on the feedback.
- Based on the feedback, we thought it was important to provide an option for users to edit/remove their posts due to privacy concerns in order to make our product more ethical. This fits into the Room Poster user story and the features users might want. 

## Part 3: Paper Prototype (TODO)
- Three use cases for our prototype are:
1. Finding information about a specific dorm room on campus. (Alternative flow: room has not yet been reviewed)
3. Finding information about a specific dorm building on campus
4. Posting a new room review / editing/removing past reviews. (Alternative flow: missing response fields)

### One or more photos of your prototype

### Photos of your team working on the prototype


### Review questions: (Ask these to stakeholders)
- What aspects of the interface were intuitive to use? What aspects were not? Why? What would make them easier to use?
- How likely are you/would you have been to use this product for room draw? What is the primary purpose you would use it for?
- How likely is it that you would post a review? How likely would you be to browse the rooms?
- What type of information would you like to see about the dorms? The floors? And the rooms?
 - number of bathrooms, kitchen size/pictures, information about surrounding roooms
- Which elements of the interface, if any, were distracting or confusing? Why or why not?
- How comfortable would you feel posting pictures of your furnished room?

## Test 1 (Classmate)
### Who you tested it with.
- Budhil
### A narrative describing the test.
 - Budhil is a student who is browsing to find details on Gates 8100, a room he would like to live in next year. He is planning to live with one roommate and wants to find a double room.
### What roles did each team member play during the test?
- Ella: Facilitator
- Nitin: Computer
- Ian: Note taker
### Which user stories were activated?
- "As a group dorm seeker, I need to be able to find rooms that are designed exactly for the size of my roommate group."
### Additional notes describing the session, e.g. observations of the test user's behavior.
- The user did not have any issue navigating the interface. He interacted with our application in roughly the way we would expect.
### The feedback you got from the tester
- Budhil requested navigation buttons between webpages to make going back easier. He also inquired about adding upvotes and downvotes to the comments or a flag option.
### Notes on how to revise your testing procedure for the next user
- We should slow down some and give a better description of the use case we are testing. Budhil was prone to go outside the use case because we had not made his goal clear.
### Describe changes to your prototype
- We added a flag option on the user reviews to allow users to flag any content (false/inappropriate) they feel should be reviewed by admin.
### other changes your team decided to make from your own thoughts and ideas from the testing session
- When a room does not have any reviews yet, it provides a link to post a review for the room. When they are naviated to post the review, we will ideally have the dorm room information (cluster, building, floor, room number) propogated already.
### other things you added to your prototype, not necessarily based on the testing session
- We added an option for users to see all of their reviews and delete any they may have made a mistake on or do not wish to share anymore. We also added a dorm and floor information panel on each respective screen to better highlight details of each.
### Include one or more photos of your revised prototype where the difference between the original and revised version can be plainly seen

## Test 2 (Professor)
### Who you tested it with.
- Leah
### A narrative describing the test.
 - A user seeking to post a review, look at their past reviews, and explore dorm rooms. 
### What roles did each team member play during the test?
- Mac: Facilitator
- Rene: Computer

### The feedback you got from the tester
- Leah suggested that we should add a popup for the user to confirm that they would like to delete a review they have posted.
### Notes on how to revise your testing procedure for the next user
- We have created standardized review questions to ask users after each test.
### Describe changes to your prototype
- We added a popup that asks the user to confirm that they would like to delete a review.
### other changes your team decided to make from your own thoughts and ideas from the testing session
- Add a save button when editing past reviews, add a popup that says "are you sure" after clicking delete on a past review.
- Add a popup to allows users to explain why they have flagged/reported a review. 
### other things you added to your prototype, not necessarily based on the testing session
- We added a page to look at all past reviews, that the user gets naviagated to once they post a new review. 
### Include one or more photos of your revised prototype where the difference between the original and revised version can be plainly seen

## Test 3 (Kailee)
- We tested with Kailee, a fourth-year Grinnell College student who is a real stakeholder in our website. She is a naive user, as she did not know about our project before our test with her. 
- We were interested in exploring the use case for room poster, and were interested in learning about whether fourth-year students would be interested in reviewing rooms on our website even if they are graduating and will not participate in room selection again.
### Date and time of the test session
- Tuesday February 25 at 5:01pm
### A narrative describing the test.
- Kailee was instructed first to act like a student who was exploring the website for the first time. She began by browsing rooms and then posted a review of her current room.
### What roles did each team member play during the test?
- Facilitator: Ella
- Computer: Tim
- Note taker: Ian
### Which user stories were activated?
- Room Poster
- Room Seeker
### Additional notes describing the session, e.g. observations of the test user's behavior.
- The session went pretty smoothly, but she bypassed a lot of the preliminary information about the buildings and floors and just wanted to get to the room information. Despite being a fourth year and not participating in room selection again, she was curious to explore the dorm room reviews.
- She did not seem to notice or be interested in the general information we included about the dorm building.
### The feedback you got from the tester
- She questioned whether the pictures should be related to the reviews they came with or whether they should be in separate panes. She also inquired about filtering rooms and sorting based on highest rating, and comparing rooms in all of the dorms in one page. She also noted the shifting placement of the home button and its small size relative to the information on the page.
### Describe changes to your prototype
- We decided not to change the position of the home button in the prototype due to lack of space on each page, but made a note of it for our actual website.
- We will ask the next user how they feel about the setup of the room details page and whether they like the setup of the panes (all comments grouped and all images grouped) or if they would like to see images paired with their respetive reviews.
### other changes your team decided to make from your own thoughts and ideas from the testing session
- We discussed the pros/cons of changing our searching process to be more fluid. 
### other things you added to your prototype, not necessarily based on the testing session
- n/a
### 3 major questions that you asked the test user for feedback on, and the test user's responses.
*Q: How likely are you/would you have been to use this product for room draw? What is the primary purpose you would use it for? 

 A: She would be likely to post a room review even though she is graduating. She would think it would be fun to browse reviews as well, even though she will not use that information to select a room. 

*Q: Which elements of the interface, if any, were distracting or confusing? Why or why not? 

 A: The home button should be larger on every page, and should have a standard placement on the top left. 

*Q: How comfortable would you feel posting pictures of your furnished room? 

 A: She would feel self conscious if someone who knew where she lived was able to trace the review back to her, but would not feel unsafe when posting reviews.

## Test 4 (Jacob)
- We tested this with Jacob, a first-year Grinnell College student who is a real stakeholder in our website. He is a naive user, as he did not know about our project before our test with him. 
- We tested with Jacob because we were interested in the perspective of a first-year student and learning what functionality he would like in the website. He has not participated in the room selection process before. 
### Date and time of the test session
- Tuesday February 25 at 5:30pm
### A narrative describing the test.
- Jacob was instructed to browse dorm rooms. 
### What roles did each team member play during the test?
- Facilitator: Mac
- Computer: Nitin
- Note taker: Ella
### Which user stories were activated?
- Room Poster
- Room Reviewer
### Additional notes describing the session, e.g. observations of the test user's behavior.
- User was first interested in exploring the dorms, and then went back and explore the review room option.
- He did not seem to notice or be interested in the general information we included about the dorm building.
### The feedback you got from the tester
- He would use the website to both post rooms and review rooms. He would be less likely to use the website if he had to post a review before being able to see other reviews.  The information he would be most interested to learn is the size of the room (by seeing photos) and other general information like how many bathrooms are on a floor.
- He would also like functionality to easily compare rooms in different halls in order get information about what a standard single/double/triple is based on the hall building.
### Describe changes to your prototype
- We sketched a whiteboard prototype for the search page illustrating an alternative way to filter rooms to ask future testers if they would prefer that to our current functionality.
### other changes your team decided to make from your own thoughts and ideas from the testing session
- Make the dorm building info bigger on the page so users notice it, and don't immediately click on the floor to find rooms. 

### 3 major questions that you asked the test user for feedback on, and the test user's responses.

### Spontaneous feedback from the test user, and questions you came up with on the spot
- We asked him about display of information on each room review, and he prefers having the images and comments in separate sections instead of linking images to their respective comments. This differs from Kailee's opinions.
### Summarize the changes to your requirements after each test and describe why you made each change

### Photos of revised prototype

## Test 5 (Devon)
- We tested this with Devon, a Grinnell College student on the football team who is a real stakeholder in our website. He is a naive user, as he did not know about our project before our test with him. 
- Such as with Jacob, we tested with Devon because we were interested in the perspective of a student-athlete and learning what functionality he would like in the website.
### Date and time of the test session
- Tuesday February 25 at 6:15
### A narrative describing the test.
-  Devon was given the opportunity to navigate the website on his own.
### What roles did each team member play during the test?
- Facilitator: Ian
- Computer: Nitin
- Note taker: Rene
### Which user stories were activated?
- Room reviewer
- Room seeker
### Additional notes describing the session, e.g. observations of the test user's behavior.
- He followed the prompts as expected. 
- He clicked on the room location on the floor plan image to view its information instead of the room number in the list of rooms. He corrected this action when Nitin initially did not change the screen.
- He did not seem to care about the general dorm information provided, and just cared about room information.
- It was initially unclear to him as to what the button to see your past reviews did and why one would need that functionality.
### The feedback you got from the tester
- At first, he told us he liked the design and it was straighforward and easy to use. When we asked him if he would prefer the alternative filtering option we had drawn on the whiteboard, he told us he would prefer that option. He said that he does not have a specific dorm building or floor preference, and would rather compare the rooms themselves regardless of their location. He did say that this option wouldn't be as helpful if there were not enough reviews on the website, and he would be unlikely to use the website if thre was a noticable lack of rooms that had been reviewed.
- Room vs. the Hall information. If user prioritizes room information only, then could potentially remove additional steps of going through region, dorm, floor, to the room itself. (search bar)

### Describe changes to your prototype
- We changed the location and text on the button to view your past reviews in order to help users understand/distinguish that this option is related to their personal reivews and is viewable only to them.
