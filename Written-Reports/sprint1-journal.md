# Sprint 1 Journal
## Part 1: Revise requirements based on feedback (TODO)
- Summarize the feedback from your reviews.
- Describe the changes, if any, that you are making to your requirements, user personas, user stories, use cases, and prototype based on these reviews.
Describe your rationale in deciding what changes to make (or not make) based on the reviews.

## Part 3: Paper Prototype (TODO)
- One or more photos of your prototype
- You might also want to include photos of your team working on the prototype! (optional)
- Enumerate three use cases that the prototype models

### Review questions: (Ask these to stakeholders)
- What aspects of the interface were intuitive to use? What aspects were not? Why? What would make them easier to use?
- How likely are you/would you have been to use this product for room draw? What is the primary purpose you would use it for?
- How likely is it that you would post a review? How likely would you be to browse the rooms?
- What type of information would you like to see about the dorms? The floors? And the rooms?
- Were any elements of the interface distracting or confusing? Why or why not?
- Would you feel comfortable posting pictures of your furnished room?

## Test 1 (Classmate)
### Who you tested it with.
- Budhil
### A narrative describing the test.
 - Budhil is a student who is browsing to find details on Gates 8100, a room he would like to live in next year. He is planning to live with one roommate and wants to find a double room.
### What roles did each team member play during the test?
- Ella: Facilitator
- Nitin: Computer
- Ian: Note taker
### Which user stories were activated?
- "As a group dorm seeker, I need to be able to find rooms that are designed exactly for the size of my roommate group."
### Additional notes describing the session, e.g. observations of the test user's behavior.
- The user did not have any issue navigating the interface. He interacted with our application in roughly the way we would expect.
### The feedback you got from the tester
- Budhil requested navigation buttons between webpages to make going back easier. He also inquired about adding upvotes and downvotes to the comments or a flag option.
### Notes on how to revise your testing procedure for the next user
- We should slow down some and give a better description of the use case we are testing. Budhil was prone to go outside the use case because we had not made his goal clear.
### Describe changes to your prototype
- We will add a flag option on the user reviews to allow users to flag any content they feel should be reviewed by admin.
### other changes your team decided to make from your own thoughts and ideas from the testing session
- When linking an unreviewed room to a review page, we will ideally have the dorm room information propogated already.
### other things you added to your prototype, not necessarily based on the testing session
- We will add an option for users to see all of their reviews and delete any they may have made a mistake on or do not wish to share anymore. We also will add a dorm and floor information panel on each respective screen to better highlight details of each.
### Include one or more photos of your revised prototype where the difference between the original and revised version can be plainly seen

### The feedback you got from the tester
- adding a box that let the user confirm after they press the delete button for their reviews
### Notes on how to revise your testing procedure for the next user
- we have created standardized review questions to ask users after each test.
### Describe changes to your prototype
- there will be a page that allow the user to confirm after they click the delete button.
### other changes your team decided to make from your own thoughts and ideas from the testing session
- Add a save button when editing past reviews, add a popup that says "are you sure" after clicking delete on a past review.
- Add a popup to allows users to explain why they have flagged/reported a review. 
### other things you added to your prototype, not necessarily based on the testing session
- We added a page to look at all past reviews, that the user gets naviagated to once they post a new review.

## Test 3 (Kailee)
- We tested this with Kailee, a fourth-year Grinnell College student who is a real stakeholder in our website.
- We tested with Kailee because we were interested in exploring the use case for room poster, and were interested in learning about whether fourth-year students would be interested in reviewing rooms on our website even if they are graduating and will not use the website to browse room reviews.
