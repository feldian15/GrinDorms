The purpose of sprint review is to show off what your team has completed in a way understandable to a customer. Some organizations perform product demonstrations for each sprint review. For this class, most of your sprint reviews will be a written report.

## Describe what you completed this sprint.

### How has your product improved or progressed from a customer perspective? Describe in terms of high level features that a non-technical user could recognize and appreciate.
- We changed the flow of our browse tool to allow for better custom filtering by the user. Originally, we had planned to use a step by step filter to narrow our database of rooms down by cluster, building, and floor, but this meant that the only way for users to see rooms information was by progressing completely through these options, and additionally, there was no way to compare rooms across different buildings or floors. Our new flow involves simply displaying the full database of rooms from the browse page, from which a user can then use their own filtering criteria to narrow the searches in whatever order they want. Additionally, they can sort the information to help find rooms with particular details. This new approach allows for the same functionality as our original approach, but there is additional customization available. Additionally, we have revised and streamlined the process of posting reviews and added a feature to view and edit any existing reviews. This will give the user more control over their experience and hopefully will enable more people to post information to the site.

### What progress have you made that is not visible to a common user?
- We have played around with various implementation ideas for our product to familiarize ourselves with the technology. This includes constructing a template demo website, although this will need to be adjusted since it follows our old workflow.
